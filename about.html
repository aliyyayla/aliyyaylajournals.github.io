            <p>I am a 21 years old college student studying creative coding course in Bathspa University. I haven't fulfilled anything academically yet as I am still in my first year hence, why I created my own website.
            God-willing one day, I get to be a successful person doing the things I love while working hard on my chosen field.
            <br> <br> My personal life consist of dancing and playing volleyball. I love that I still get to enjoy them in the mist of my busy academic life. 
            <br> <br> I created this website out of inspiration. I have been following so many digital creators who share their talents and skills through making aesthetic mood boards for others to use. 
            <br> <br> I hope this website help you not only with your moodboard but to be inspired as well.
